# AI Prompts Used in Development

## Project Setup and Structure
1. "Create a web-based application with a simple user interface (UI) that facilitates data ingestion between a ClickHouse database and Flat Files. The application must support bidirectional data flow, handle JWT token-based authentication, allow column selection, and report record counts."

## Backend Development
1. "Create a FastAPI backend with endpoints for ClickHouse connection, table listing, column selection, and data ingestion."
2. "Implement JWT token-based authentication for ClickHouse connections."
3. "Create endpoints for file upload and download functionality."

## Frontend Development
1. "Create a React TypeScript frontend with Material-UI components for a modern interface."
2. "Implement a step-by-step wizard interface for data ingestion."
3. "Create components for source selection, connection configuration, column selection, data preview, and process status."

## Docker Configuration
1. "Create Docker Compose configuration for the full stack application including ClickHouse, backend, and frontend services."
2. "Create Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend services."

## Testing and Documentation
1. "Create comprehensive README with setup instructions, usage guide, and testing information."
2. "Document error handling and troubleshooting steps."

## Implementation Details
1. "Implement bidirectional data flow between ClickHouse and flat files."
2. "Add progress tracking and completion reporting."
3. "Implement data preview functionality."
4. "Add error handling with user-friendly messages."

## Code Review and Optimization
1. "Review and optimize the code for performance and security."
2. "Ensure proper error handling and user feedback."
3. "Implement efficient data handling with batching/streaming."

Note: These prompts were used with an AI coding assistant to help develop the application. The actual implementation was done through iterative development and testing.
